## Kotlin DSLs demystified

Kotlin DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) have found versatile uses across various domains. They find application in Gradle as an alternative to Groovy or in libraries like Ktor for endpoint declaration, Compose for describing UIs, and kotlinx.html as template engine for HTML rendering. One key advantage of such DSLs is their facilitation of type-safe builders, offering a more concise and less verbose API.
In this talk we will deep dive into the mysteries of Kotlin DSLs and reveal which tricks used to create them.

To show all of this in action, a DSL will be live-coded during this talk.

...and, how are photo books involved in all of this?
