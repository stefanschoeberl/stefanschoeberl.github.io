WebAssembly is a fairly new web standard, which promises to bring new languages to the web and enables better performance in web applications.
Many programming languages and frameworks have added support for WebAssembly in the last years.
Typically, one does not see or need to interact with WebAssembly directly.

But how does WebAssembly work on a fundamental level?

What does the Bytecode of WebAssembly look like and how does the interaction with the browser ecosystem work? 

In this talk we will take a closer look at the architecture of the WebAssembly runtime and its Bytecode.
To show all of this in action, well-known algorithms will be live-coded in WebAssembly Bytecode during this session.
