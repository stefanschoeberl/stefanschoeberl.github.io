As I have always been very passionate about mathematics (and still am), I participated in the "Applied Mathematics Week" ("Projektwoche Angewandte Mathematik") organized by JKU during my high school years.
In 2014, there was a workshop on the topic of [Polygons](http://www.projektwoche.jku.at/2014/projekt2014_proj06.shtml){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

During the workshop, we learned the fundamentals of polygons and developed algorithms for various problem statements: Does a point lie within a polygon? Do two polygons intersect? How do you calculate the area of a polygon?

We tested these algorithms with a practical example using Mathematica.
The task was to navigate a spacecraft (represented as a simplified triangle) through a tunnel using a slider.
The game was designed to detect collisions between the spacecraft and the tunnel, both of which were modeled as polygons.

Around that time, I was also learning the basics of iOS development, which motivated me to turn this small game into an app.
Thus, the "Super Polygon Collider 5000" was born.
I ported the necessary algorithms from Mathematica to Objective-C, and the graphics were implemented using SpriteKit.

The app was available for download on the official App Store for a while, but unfortunately, it is no longer available there.
