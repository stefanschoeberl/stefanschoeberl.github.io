Containers are an essential part of modern production systems and are used for virtualization and isolation of applications.
Lightweight containers reduce the resource overhead compared to a full VM (Virtual Machine) solution.

Docker is a tool and one of the most well-known in the container environment.
It allows the creation of images and the launching of containers.
Additionally, Docker provides a range of other functionalities that support software development.

This workshop is primarily aimed at beginners who have little to no experience with Docker.
The fundamentals of Docker will be demonstrated and applied through practical examples.
Participants will learn how to write Dockerfiles for their own applications and deploy container groups using Docker Compose.
Moreover, the workshop will show how Docker can be effectively utilized for personal projects and as a tool for study courses.
