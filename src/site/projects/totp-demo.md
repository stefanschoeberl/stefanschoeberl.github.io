During a [fhLUG talk](https://fhlug.at/2016/02/onetime-passwords/){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} at FH Hagenberg, I first learned of One-Time Passwords (OTPs).
I found the time-based variant (the first "T" in TOTP stands for Time) particularly interesting.

Typically, for One-Time Passwords, a secret is exchanged between the server and the user once.
This can be done, for example, during the registration process using a QR code that the user scans with a compatible app.

During subsequent logins, a code can be generated based on this secret and the current time, which is valid for a specific period.
Since the server and the app both know the secret, they can independently generate the same code â€” provided that both systems' clocks are reasonably synchronized.

This led to the creation of a small web application that allows users to try out this workflow. The only requirement is an app that supports otpauth:// URIs (such as Google Authenticator).
